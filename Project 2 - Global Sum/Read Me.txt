Global Sum

Write a global sum operation with MPI
You are to write a function with the following specification:

void global_sum(double* result, int rank, int size, double my_value);

Task: 

Write a parallel program and associated helper executables, according to the exact
functionality given below, to open a binary file with integers in it, and find the sum of all
the numbers.
In the parallel version, you will use a block decomposition so that each
processor will be find a partial sum of its portion of the file. Then, the final summation of
the partial sums will be done using our global_sum() function from the last assignment.
