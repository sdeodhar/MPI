Ring of Processes

Imagine that all processes are logically connected in a ring topology as follows:
Process rank is connected only to processes (rank + 1) % size and (rank â€“ 1) % size.
Therefore, processes (not processors) can send and receive data only to and from their
adjacent neighbors. Note that the ring wraps around, i.e. process 0's left neighbor is
process (size - 1) and process (size - 1)'s right neighbor is process 0.
